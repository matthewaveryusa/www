I've been running a homeserver from a QNAP TS-251 2-Bay NAS since July of 2015. A few months ago I retired the QNAP in favor of a refurbished desktop. While the QNAP had great software and low power consumption, the hardware wasn t good enough for on-the-fly transcoding. Even after upgrading to 8GB or RAM I wasn t able to transcode 1080p videos to my cell phone without significant rebuffering. On the other hand the i5 on my refurbished machine can easily handle transcoding 4k videos to my cellphone without pegging the CPU. I added two extra ethernet ports for future expansions, a small SSD that I boot the OS from Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic), A RAID-1ed set of 2TB disks, and an 8TB external drive for local backups that I keep mostly offline. This hardware gives me plenty of capacity to run multiple websites, a mailserver, and a plex media server. My main observation is that to get started with a homeserver you don t need expensive or specialized hardware. For less than 300 dollars I was able to purchase way more CPU and RAM from a refurb than any new pre-packaged hardware branded as a NAS or homeserver. In terms of network hardware I have two routers. The main router is used for all our devices and regular wifi access. The second router is used to connect the homserver, which sits our TV, to the main router without having to run a cable.
